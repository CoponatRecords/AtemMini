'''
Automatic Scene Switcher for Atem Mini

ToDo :
    add  gui
    regroup both scripts on one start button
'''

'''
This script reads the instrument_status.txt file and piano_status.txt to switch cameras
The Atem mini has to be on and connected through ethernet. Check the connection status with the "Atem Setup" app.
The Instrument_Level script has to be on 
Ableton needs to have AbletonOSC installed : https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC

To run this script : right-click, run 'main'
